# How to use Vinny
1. To use Vinny in your discord server you must first add it. You can do so by following the link above. Do not edit any of the permissions that Vinny requests, those are the minimum permissions it needs to do what it does. 
2. Once Vinny is in your server you can start to run commands. By default you can start a command with either `~` or by @'ing vinny then following it with the name of the command. Example: `~sinfo` or `@Vinny sinfo`. To see a [full list of commands, go here](docs/Commands.md)
3. Vinny does have a permissions setup, this is enforced everywhere except for DMs. By default all channels have nsfw disabled. To enable it for a channel, the channel must be set as NSFW in discord and an admin needs to run the `enablensfw` command. Some commands like the reddit commands allow to be used in non-nsfw channels, but will refuse to post nsfw content there. However will post any content when they are used in an NSFW enabled channel.
